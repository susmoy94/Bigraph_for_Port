The repository contains the files relating to expressing and analysing a simple model of port operations using Bigraphs. The subdirectories suffixed with 'small' and 'large' are the same models initialised with a different set of vehicles. The former is initialised with $2$ cars and $2$ trucks whereas the latter with $6$ cars and $3$ trucks. For both these models, the state-space of the bigraph evolves using rules with weights (stochastic rates) implying the underlying Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS) is stochastic in nature. In order to validate and analyse the model, we export the state-space as a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) using BigraphER, a state-of-the-art toolset developed to model, analyse and visualise bigraphs. The tool comes with the feature to export
